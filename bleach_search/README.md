# Bleach Search

This is a WIP project for fans of the Bleach manga/anime. The goal is to offer users a way to pass a character and see which chapters/episodes that character appears in. This was built by scraping the [Bleach Wiki](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Bleach_Wiki), and down the line the ability to return the actual summaries of chapters/episodes from the Bleach Wiki where that character appears will be available as well. Other features in the pipeline will include passing a manga chapter and returning which anime episodes are adapted from that chapter (or vice versa).
