# Alia's Portfolio

This is a collection of various Python tools/scripts I've built recently (which is actively being expanded). Below is a summary of each section.
***
### alia_toolbox

Variety of small helper functions. Right now there are 2 categories:
- <b>Helpers [[x](https://github.com/aliavictor/portfolio/blob/main/alia_toolbox/alia_toolbox/helpers.py)]:</b> Practical/functional tools that span a range of uses, from calculations to file manipulation
- <b>Colors [[x](https://github.com/aliavictor/portfolio/blob/main/alia_toolbox/alia_toolbox/colors.py)]:</b> Aesthetic tools that give the user stylistic control over printed outputs

### bleach_search

WIP project for fans of the Bleach manga/anime. Right now the only functionality is passing a certain character and returning a summary of all the episodes/chapters that character appears in. Details about additional features in the pipeline are summarized in the [README](https://github.com/aliavictor/portfolio/blob/main/bleach_search/README.md).

### facebook_tools

Tools built on Facebook's marketing API for the management of ad campaigns. Currently only supports `GET` requests (both single/synchronous and bulk/asynchronous), but much more functionality is on the way.

### google_tools

Essentially just little helper tools built with `pygsheets`. With the [GSheets class](https://github.com/aliavictor/portfolio/blob/main/google_tools/google_tools/__init__.py) the user can pull Google Spreadsheets into pandas dataframes quickly and easily, likewise they can insert dataframes into spreadsheets as well.

### misc_scripts

Contrary to the rest of the repo, this section doesn't contain deploy-ready tools but is instead a collection of dummy scripts. These are less about functionality and more about providing insight into how I code/solve problems.
